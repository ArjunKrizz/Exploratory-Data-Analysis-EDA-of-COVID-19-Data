# Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Dataset

This repository contains an analysis of the COVID-19 dataset, aiming to provide insights into the pandemic. 

Here are the objectives and tasks covered:

1 - Load required libraries: Import necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2- Check head and tail: Examine the first and last few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

3- Column names: Identify the names of the columns present in the dataset.

4- Data types and information: Explore the data types of each column and gather relevant information about the dataset.

5- Statistics information: Compute statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., to understand the data distribution.

6- Missing data: Identify missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.

7- Analysis using appropriate graphs: Utilize suitable graphs (e.g., bar charts, line plots) to analyze the dataset, focusing on the highest cases for at least 5 countries across different variables.

- Less affected countries: Identify countries with a lower impact of COVID-19 based on available data.

- Variable interaction using pairplot: Examine the relationships between variables using a pairplot, enabling the visualization of pairwise interactions.

- Outlier detection: Identify outliers in the dataset using statistical methods and visualization techniques.

- Correlation analysis: Perform a correlation analysis to understand the relationships between variables and uncover potential patterns.

- This repository serves as a valuable resource for analyzing COVID-19 data, gaining insights into the pandemic's impact, and facilitating informed decision-making
